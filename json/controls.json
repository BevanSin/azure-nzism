    "displayName": "Radio Frequency Identification Devices - Authentication",
    "description": "Both an RFID reader and RFID tag share a common secret key that can be used in combination with a hash algorithm to provide one-way or mutual authentication between tag and reader. This is known as a Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC). When HMAC is applied to messages, it also assures the integrity of data in the messages. HMAC is not specified in any RFID standard, but the capability is generally available in vendor products. HMAC is often used where the risk of eavesdropping is high and passwords alone are considered to offer an inadequate authentication mechanism. This will be determined by the risk assessment. HMAC is also used where applications require evidence of a tag�s authenticity. https://www.nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#SubSection-14250"

In a supply chain application, for example, tags may be turned off to prevent unauthorised access to the tags during shipment. This feature is useful when communication between readers and a tag is infrequent allowing the tag to be activated when required but limiting vulnerability to rogue transactions if left operational for extended periods with no authorised activity. Temporary deactivation can also extend battery life in powered tags. https://www.nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#SubSection-14250"

    "description": "Encrypting the internal storage and removable media of agency owned mobile devices will reduce the risk of data loss associated with a lost or stolen device. While the use of encryption may not be suitable to treat the device as an unclassified asset it will still present a significant challenge to a malicious actor looking to gain easy access to information stored on the device. To ensure that the benefits of encryption on mobile devices are maintained, users must not store passphrases, passwords, PINS or other access codes for the encryption software on, or with, the device. https://www.nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#SubSection-17022"
