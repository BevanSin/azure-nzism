01.1.68.C.01.|01. About information security|Understanding and using the NZISM - Reviewing non-compliance|As part of the process of providing justification for a dispensation to the Accreditation Authority, an assessment of the degree of compliance, identification of areas of non-compliance and determination of residual security risk is undertaken by the agency or lead agency. This assessment is based on the risk environment at the time the dispensation is sought. As the risk environment will continue to evolve over time it is important that agencies revisit the assessment on an annual basis and update it according to the current risk environment, and if necessary reverse any decisions to grant a dispensation if the security risk is no longer of an acceptable level.|https://www.nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document/#SubSection-12064

11.6.66.C.01.|11. Communications Systems and Devices|Radio Frequency Identification Devices - Authentication|Both an RFID reader and RFID tag share a common secret key that can be used in combination with a hash algorithm to provide one-way or mutual authentication between tag and reader. This is known as a Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC). When HMAC is applied to messages, it also assures the integrity of data in the messages. HMAC is not specified in any RFID standard, but the capability is generally available in vendor products. HMAC is often used where the risk of eavesdropping is high and passwords alone are considered to offer an inadequate authentication mechanism. This will be determined by the risk assessment. HMAC is also used where applications require evidence of a tag s authenticity.|https://www.nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#SubSection-14250

11.6.68.C.01.|11. Communications Systems and Devices|Radio Frequency Identification Devices - Temporary Deactivation of Tags|The RF interface on some tags can be temporarily deactivated. In a supply chain application, for example, tags may be turned off to prevent unauthorised access to the tags during shipment. This feature is useful when communication between readers and a tag is infrequent allowing the tag to be activated when required but limiting vulnerability to rogue transactions if left operational for extended periods with no authorised activity. Temporary deactivation can also extend battery life in powered tags.|https://www.nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#SubSection-14250

This trust can be exploited by obtaining certificates from a commercial certificate authority under false pretences, as devices can be tricked into trusting their signed certificate. This will allow the capture of authentication credentials presented by devices, which in the case of EAP-MSCHAPv2 can be cracked using a brute force attack granting not only network access but most likely Active Directory credentials as well.To reduce this risk, devices can be configured to: validate the server certificate; disable any trust for certificates generated by commercial certificate authorities that are not trusted; disable the ability to prompt users to authorise net servers or commercial certificate authorities; and set devices to enable identity privacy to prevent usernames being sent prior to being authenticated by the RADIUS server.|https://www.nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#SubSection-16250

18.2.13.C.01.|18. Network security|Wireless Local Area Networks|When 802.1X authentication is used, a shared secret key known as the Pairwise Master Key (PMK) is generated. Upon successful authentication of a device, the PMK can be cached to assist with fast roaming between wireless access points. When a device roams away from a wireless access point that it has authenticated to, it will not need to perform a full re-authentication should it roam back while the cached PMK remains valid. To further assist with roaming, wireless access points can be configured to pre-authenticate a device to other neighbouring wireless access points that the device might roam to. Although requiring full authentication for a device each time it roams between wireless access points is ideal, agencies can chose to use PMK caching and pre-authentication if they have a business requirement for fast roaming. If PMK caching is used, the PMK caching period should not be set to greater than 1440 minutes (24 hours).|https://www.nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#SubSection-16250

During the initial configuration of wireless networks using 802.1X authentication, a shared secret is entered into either the wireless access points or the RADIUS server. If configured on the wireless access points, the shared secret is sent to the RADIUS server via the RADIUS protocol, and vice versa if configured on the RADIUS server.

A malicious actor seeking to exploit vulnerabilities in TKIP and WEP can attempt to connect to wireless access points using one of these protocols. By default, wireless access points will attempt to accommodate this request by falling back to a legacy protocol that the device supports.

While this ensures that the existence of wireless networks are not broadcast overtly using beacon frames, the SSID is still broadcast in probe requests, probe responses, association requests and re-association requests for the network. Malicious actors can determine the SSID of wireless networks by capturing these requests and responses. By disabling SSID broadcasting agencies will make it more difficult for legitimate users to connect to wireless networks as legacy operating systems have only limited support for hidden SSIDs. Disabling SSID broadcasting infringes the design of the 802.11x standards.|https://www.nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#SubSection-16250

Assigning static IP addresses for devices accessing wireless networks can prevent a rogue device when connecting to a network from being assigned a routable IP address. However, some malicious actors will be able to determine IP addresses of legitimate users and use this information to guess or spoof valid IP address ranges for wireless networks.

18.2.31.C.01.|18. Network security|Wireless Local Area Networks - Connecting wireless networks to fixed networks|When an agency has a business requirement to connect a wireless network to a fixed network, it is important that they consider the security risks. While fixed networks can be designed with a certain degree of physical security, wireless networks are often easily accessible outside of the agency s controlled area. Treating connections between wireless networks and fixed networks in the same way agencies would treat connections between fixed networks and the Internet can help protect against an intrusion originating from a wireless network against a fixed network. For example, agencies can implement a gateway to inspect and control the flow of information between the two networks.|https://www.nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#SubSection-16250
18.2.32.C.01.|18. Network security|Wireless Local Area Networks - Wireless network footprint and Radio Frequency (RF) Controls|Minimising the output power of wireless access points will reduce the footprint of wireless networks. Instead of deploying a small number of wireless access points that broadcast on high power, more wireless access points that use minimal broadcast power should be deployed to achieve the desired wireless network footprint. This has the added benefit of providing redundancy for a wireless network should a wireless access point become unserviceable. In such a case, the output power of other wireless access points can be temporarily increased to cover the footprint gap until the unserviceable wireless access point can be replaced.|https://www.nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#SubSection-16250
18.2.33.C.01.|18.

20.3.8.C.01.|20. Data management|Content Filtering - Content conversion and transformation|Content conversion, file conversion or file transformation can be an effective method to render potentially malicious content harmless by separating the presentation format from the data. By converting a file to another format, the exploit, active content and/or payload can often be removed or disrupted enough to be ineffective.Examples of file conversion and content transformation to mitigate the threat of content exploitation include: converting a Microsoft Word document to a PDF file; converting a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation to a series of JPEG images; converting a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet to a Comma Separated Values (CSV) file; or converting a PDF document to a plain text file. Some file types, such as XML, will not benefit from conversion.

20.3.9.C.01.|20. Data management|Content Filtering - Content sanitisation|Sanitisation is the process of attempting to make potentially malicious content safe to use by removing or altering active content while leaving the original content as intact as possible. Sanitisation is not as secure a method of content filtering as conversion, though many techniques may be combined. Extraneous application and protocol data, including metadata, should also be inspected and filtered where possible. Examples of sanitisation to mitigate the threat of content exploitation include: removal of document properties information in Microsoft Office documents; removal or renaming of Javascript sections from PDF files; removal of metadata such as EXIF information from within JPEG files.|https://www.nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#SubSection-16926
